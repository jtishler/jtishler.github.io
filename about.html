                <strong>Artist Statement</strong><br><br>
                Nowadays, the digital world is a key part of our everyday lives. Screens permeate many activities, from school, to work, to art. Yet even with the continually advancing digital art tools available, I have never wavered in my love for the traditional mediums of drawing and painting. As a Computer Science and Visual Art double concentrator, I have tried many ways of combining my two disciplines. However, I kept missing painting and drawing when taking digital art classes. I started to think that I wanted to keep my two concentrations separate, but then I came to idea of having them in conversation. Since childhood I’ve felt pulled in two different directions by my passions for the arts and STEM, but I’ve come to realize how much my two fields inform each other. Creativity, problem-solving, and synthesis are at the foundation of both disciplines and are the reasons why I love both painting and coding. Thus, for my senior capstone I explored the ways digital art and painting can exist together in artwork. Can one enhance the other? Does one overpower the other? How can I emphasize each of their qualities? How can I use this combination to create more effective works than with either medium alone? In my pieces, I don’t want it to seem like these two aspects are fighting, because to me they aren’t. They are two important parts of myself that I have embraced and discovered work well both together and separately as means of expression.

                <br><strong>Flicker:</strong><br>
                The animation for Flicker was created in Photoshop. I wanted to use the Photoshop animation and light from the projector to enhance this painting in a subtle way.<br><br>

                <strong>Gomorra:</strong><br>
                Gomorra, originally a book, but now also a movie and a TV series, is an important work in Italy. It is an expose of the Neopolitan mafia, the Camorra, written by Roberto Saviano.
                Each of the three pieces in this series represents one component of the Gomorra narrative ecosystem.
                To create each piece, I engaged with one component of Gomorra, and then created an abstract image baed off the emotions and thoughts that surfaced.
                Then, I projected a video of the relevant component onto the painting.<br><br>

                <strong>Smarginatura:</strong><br>
                Smarginatura is an Italian word that most closely translates to bleeding or dissolving margins.
                The term comes from the book series, The Neopolitan Novels. The first novel, My Brilliant Friend, is an international bestseller and was turned into a TV series.
                I read My Brilliant Friend, or L'amica geniale, partially in Italian and partially in English, and then watched the TV series in Italian with English substitles.
                While creating this painting, I listened to the soundtrack of the TV series, and painted both with and without the projected video playing.
                The painting is meant to capture the intangible feeling of smarginatura and critique the differing representations of the idea in the book and the TV series.<br><br>

                <strong>Failure:</strong><br>
                Unlike the other pieces, Failure is acrylic paint on tyvek. 
                The prompt from my professor was to think of a slogan that could "revolutionize your life".
                I chose this quote from Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull, one of the co-founders of Pixar,
                as a sort of call out to myself as I definitely tend to overplan things.
                In fact, I found myself overplanning this piece, so in the spirit of the quote I let go a bit and just went with my instincts. <br><br>

                <strong>Sketchy:</strong><br>
                The base of Sketchy is an oil painting done from a photograph I took in Greece this past summer. 
                The drawing software used to engage with the piece is created using p5.js, which is a library that helps you use code to make visual sketches.
                It is based off of the Sketchy project I did in CS15 my first semester at Brown, but I translated the project into Javascript (and simplified it) to allow for engagement over the web.
                Originally, when my show was going to be in person, I was going to project the Sketchy software onto this painting and have a mouse available so viewers could engage in person.
                I created this painting by projecting the photo onto the canvas, which is a very traditional mode of painting, in order to get the image precise and choose the sections I wanted to leave out.
                While trying to figure out what sections to keep, I took photos of my painting and sketched in the parts I left out.
                This is what inspired me to make the piece interactive and give everyone else an opportunity to sketch out it as well.
