            Nowadays, the digital world is a key part of our everyday lives. Screens permeate many activities, from school, to work, to art. Yet even with the continually advancing digital art tools available, I have never wavered in my love for the traditional mediums of drawing and painting. As a Computer Science and Visual Art double concentrator, I have tried many ways of combining my two disciplines. However, I kept missing painting and drawing when taking digital art classes. I started to think that I wanted to keep my two concentrations separate, but then I came to idea of having them in conversation. Since childhood I’ve felt pulled in two different directions by my passions for the arts and STEM, but I’ve come to realize how much my two fields inform each other. Creativity, problem-solving, and synthesis are at the foundation of both disciplines and are the reasons why I love both painting and coding. Thus, for my senior capstone I explored the ways digital art and painting can exist together in artwork. Can one enhance the other? Does one overpower the other? How can I emphasize each of their qualities? How can I use this combination to create more effective works than with either medium alone? In my pieces, I don’t want it to seem like these two aspects are fighting, because to me they aren’t. They are two important parts of myself that I have embraced and discovered work well both together and separately as means of expression.
